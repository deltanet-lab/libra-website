本指南介绍了如何使用Libra命令行界面（CLI）客户端与Libra区块链进行交互。 CLI作为交互式外壳程序被调用。 它提供了创建帐户，铸造硬币，执行转账和查询区块链的基本命令。 您可以通过指定节点的主机名，使用CLI客户端与测试网上，本地Libra区块链或远程区块链上的验证程序节点进行交互。

## 调用
有三种方法可以调用Libra命令行界面客户端。

### 通过CLI客户端连接到测试网络
要通过CLI连接到testnet，可以使用便捷脚本来调用CLI，而无需指定参数。 要调用它，请转到`libra`目录并运行：

```bash
./scripts/cli/start_cli_testnet.sh
```

### 运行本地Libra网络并启动CLI客户端
要启动本地Libra网络并生成连接到该本地网络的CLI客户端，请运行：

```bash
cargo run -p libra_swarm -- -s

```
-s选项使CLI在本地Libra网络启动后运行。 请注意，这可能需要几分钟才能构建，然后再开始。

### 运行CLI客户端以连接到任何Libra网络
要调用CLI客户端并自行配置，请运行：

```bash
cargo run -p client --bin client -- [OPTIONS] --host <host> --validator_set_file <validator_set_file>

```

#### 选项

用于运行CLI客户端命令以连接到任何Libra网络的选项为：

* `-m | --faucet_key_file_path` &mdash; Path to the generated key-pair for the faucet account. The faucet account can be used to mint coins. If not passed, a new key-pair will be generated for you and placed in a temporary directory. To manually generate a keypair, use generate_keypair: `cargo run -p generate_keypair -- -o <output_file_path>`.
* `-f | --faucet_server` &mdash; The host that operates a faucet service. If not passed, this will be derived from the host parameter.
* `-a | —-host` &mdash; The destination host for CLI to connect to.
* `-p | -—port` &mdash; The public port of the destination Libra Blockchain for the client to connect with, the default value is 30307.
* `-n | --mnemonic_file` &mdash; The file location from which to load the mnemonic word for user account address/key generation. If not passed, a new mnemonic file is generated in the current directory by libra_wallet.
* `-s | --validator_set_file` &mdash; File location from which to load config of trusted validators. It is used to verify validator signatures in validator query response. The file should at least include public key of all validators trusted by the client &mdash; which should typically be all validators on the network. To connect to testnet, use 'libra/scripts/cli/trusted_peers.config.toml'. Can be generated by libra-config for local testing: `cargo run --bin libra-config` but the preferred method is to simply use libra-swarm to run local networks.

## 命令

Once started with any of the three commands previously mentioned, the following CLI commands are available:

```plaintext
major_command subcommand [options]
```

If you enter only the major command, it will show the help information for that command. Major commands can be any one of the following:

---

 #### `account | a` &mdash;  与帐户相关的操作。 子命令包括：

  `create | c` &mdash;  Create a random account with private/public key pair. Account information will be held in memory only. The created account will not be saved to the chain.

       Usage:
        create|c

  `list | la` &mdash; Print all accounts that were created or loaded.

     Usage:
        list|la

  `recover | r <file_path>` &mdash; Recover all accounts that were written to a file via the `account write` command.

     Usage:
        recover|r <file_path>
     Arguments:
         file_path - File path from which to load mnemonic recover seed.  Must have been written via `account write`

  `write | w <file path>` &mdash; Save Libra wallet mnemonic recovery seed to disk.  This will allow accounts to be recovered via `account recover`.

     Usage:
        write|w <file_path>
     Arguments:
         file_path - File path at which to save the mnemonic recovery seed to disk.


  `<mint | m> | <mintb| mb>` &mdash; Mint coins to the account. Suffix 'b' is for blocking. If blocking is specified (using suffix 'b'), CLI will query chain until the transaction is finalized/available. Same is true for other sub "blocking" commands.

      Usage:
        mint|mint|m|b <receiver_account_ref_id>|<receiver_account_address> <number_of_coins>
      Arguments:
          receiver_account_ref_id | receiver_account_address - The receiver account to mint the coins to.
                If the receiver account does not exist, it will be created first.
                Either receiver_account_address or receiver_account_ref_id (an internal index of
                the account in the CLI client) can be used to specify receiver account (as in
                other commands). If gas is being charged, the account that sent this mint transaction
                (currently preloaded genesis account) pays for the gas.
          number_of_coins - The number of coins to be minted to the receiver account.

---

#### `transfer | transferb | t | tb` &mdash; 将硬币从一个帐户转移到另一个帐户。 后缀“ b”用于阻止。

    Usage:
        transfer|transferb|t|tb <sender_account_address>|<sender_account_ref_id> <receiver_account_address>|<receiver_account_ref_id> <number_of_coins> [gas_unit_price (default=0)] [max_gas_amount (default 10000)]
    Arguments:
        sender_account_address | sender_account_ref_id - The account from which this transfer transaction
            is sent. The sender account pays for the gas.
        receive_account_address | receiver_account_ref_id - The account to which this transaction sends coins.
            If the receiver account does not exist, it will be created first. The sender will pay for
            gas required for both account creation and coin transfer.
        number_of_coins - The number of coins transferred to receiver account.
        gas_unit_price - The unit price to pay for gas.
        max_gas_amount - Max units of gas user is willing to pay for this transaction.

---

#### `query | q` &mdash; 从目标链查询数据。 所有查询操作都被阻止。 子命令包括：

`balance | b` &mdash; 获取帐户的当前余额

     Usage:
        balance | b <account_ref_id>|<account_address>
     Arguments:
         account_ref_id | account_address - The account to query balance for.

`sequence | s` &mdash; 获取帐户的当前序列号。

      Usage:
        sequence | s <account_ref_id>|<account_address> [reset_sequence_number=true|false]
      Arguments:
          account_ref_id | account_address - The account to get current/latest sequence number.
          reset_sequence_number - If the sequence number known locally by the CLI differs from the
                value known on chain, this will reset the local sequence number to to on-chain
                value.  This is useful when a user encounters an invalid sequence number error.

`account_state | as` &mdash; 获取帐户的最新状态。

      Usage:
        account_state | as <account_ref_id>|<account_address>
      Arguments:
          account_ref_id | account_address - The account to query latest state.

`txn_acc_seq | ts` &mdash; 通过帐户和序列号获取已提交的交易。

      Usage:
        txn_acc_seq | ts <account_ref_id>|<account_address> <sequence_number> <fetch_events=true|false>
      Arguments:
          account_ref_id | account_address - The account to query committed transaction.
          sequence_number - The sequence number of committed transaction.
          fetch_events - Set to true to fetch events emitted by this transaction.

`txn_range | tr` &mdash; 按范围获取已提交的交易。

      Usage:
        txn_range | tr <start_version> <limit> <fetch_events=true|false>
      Arguments:
          start_version - The version to query the transaction from.
          limit - The maximum number of transactions to query.
          fetch_events - Set to true to fetch events emitted by each transaction.

`event | ev` &mdash; 通过帐户和路径获取事件。

      Usage:
        event | ev <account_ref_id>|<account_address> <sent|received> <start_sequence_number> <ascending=true|false> <limit>
      Arguments:
          account_ref_id | account_address - The account to query events from.
          sent | received - Fetch sent or received events for this account.
                Note that this will later evolve into selecting any event path.
          start_sequence_number - The sequence number of events to query starting from.
          ascending - The direction of query from start_sequence_number.
          limit - The maximum number of events to query.

---

**`quit | q!` &mdash; 退出CLI。 没有子命令。**

---

**`help | h` &mdash; 打印帮助信息。没有子命令。**

### 在测试网上创建账户/铸币

CLI实现的帐户创建会生成一个本地密钥对，但在区块链上不会创建任何内容。 为了在区块链上创建一个账户：

* 将硬币转移到您要创建的地址。 如果接收者帐户不存在，则将首先创建接收者帐户，然后再转账硬币。 发件人为帐户创建和转帐付款。
* 发起一个铸币交易并将铸造的币发送到一个帐户。 如果该帐户不存在，则首先创建该帐户，然后再铸造硬币。 与其他交易不同，不存在的帐户本身可以要求进行铸币交易。 对于测试网，一个帐户可以铸造多少个硬币没有明确的限制。 它旨在允许用户创建硬币以在测试网上进行实验。
